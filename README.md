# 🚩 Challenge #0: 🎟 Simple Counter Example

![Hero Image](images/Screenshot%202026-02-05%20at%2021.30.57.png)

🎫 Create a simple Counter:

👷‍♀️ You'll compile and deploy your first smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy a Counter contract written in RUST to a public network to share with friends! 🚀

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that lets users interact with the counter contract. Deploy your contracts to a testnet, then build and upload your app to a public web server.

### 🚩 Challenge Setup Instructions

#### For Ubuntu/Mac Users:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone -b counter https://github.com/abhi152003/speedrun_stylus.git speedrun_stylus_counter
   ```

   ```bash
   cd speedrun_stylus_counter
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the local devnode in Docker:

   ```bash
   cd packages/stylus-demo
   ```

   ```bash

#### For Windows Users (Using WSL):

> 📝 **Note**: After completing step 4 below, make sure to follow the "Contract Address Setup" section above for configuring your contract address.

1. Open your WSL terminal.
2. Ensure you have set your Git username and email globally:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone -b counter https://github.com/abhi152003/speedrun_stylus.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd speedrun_stylus
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the local devnode in Docker:

   ```bash
   cd packages/stylus-demo
   ```

   ```bash
   bash run-dev-node.sh
   ```

5. In a second WSL terminal window, start your frontend:

   yarn run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### 1. `stylus` Not Recognized

If you encounter an error stating that `stylus` is not recognized as an external or internal command, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev
```

After that, check if `stylus` is installed by running:

```bash
cargo stylus --version
```

If the version is displayed, `stylus` has been successfully installed and the path is correctly set.

#### 2. ABI Not Generated

If you face issues with the ABI not being generated, you can try one of the following solutions:

- **Restart Docker Node**: Pause and restart the Docker node and the local setup of the project. You can do this by deleting all ongoing running containers and then restarting the local terminal using:
  ```bash
  yarn run dev
  ```
- **Modify the Script**: In the `run-dev-node.sh` script, replace the line:

  ```bash
  cargo stylus export-abi
  ```

  with:

  ```bash
  cargo run --manifest-path=Cargo.toml --features export-abi
  ```

- **Access Denied Issue**: If you encounter an access denied permission error during ABI generation, run the following command and then execute the script again:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER target
  ```

#### 3. 🚨 Fixing Line Endings and Running Shell Scripts in WSL

> ⚠️ This guide provides step-by-step instructions to resolve the Command not found error caused by CRLF line endings in shell scripts when running in a WSL environment.

Shell scripts created in Windows often have `CRLF` line endings, which cause issues in Unix-like environments such as WSL. To fix this:

**Using `dos2unix`:**

1. Install `dos2unix` (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install dos2unix
   ```

2. Convert the script's line endings:

   ```bash
   dos2unix run-dev-node.sh
   ```

3. Make the Script Executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run-dev-node.sh
   ```

4. Run the Script in WSL:
   ```bash
   bash run-dev-node.sh
   ```

## 📊 Performance Tracking

Before submitting your challenge, you can run the performance tracking script to analyze your application:

1. **Navigate to the performance tracking directory:**

   ```bash
   cd packages/nextjs/services/web3
   ```

2. **Update the contract address:**
   Open the `performanceTracking.js` file and paste the contract address that was deployed on your local node. (you can get contract address same as we have mentioned above in Docker_Img)

3. **Run the performance tracking script:**
   ```bash
   node performanceTracking.js
   ```

This will provide insights about the savings when you cache your deployed contract. The output will show performance analysis similar to the image below:

💼 Take a quick look at your deploy script `run-dev-node.sh` in `speedrun-rust/packages/stylus-demo/run-dev-node.sh`.

📝 If you want to edit the frontend, navigate to `speedrun-rust/packages/nextjs/app` and open the specific page you want to modify. For instance: `/debug/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.

---

## Checkpoint 2: 💾 Deploy your contract! 🛰

🛰 You don't need to provide any specifications to deploy your contract because contracts are automatically deployed from the `run-dev-node.sh`

> You can check that below :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d84c4d6a-be20-426b-9c68-2c021caefb29)

The above command will automatically deploy the contract functions written inside `speedrun_stylus/packages/stylus-demo/src/lib.rs`

> This local account will deploy your contracts, allowing you to avoid entering a personal private key because the deployment happens using the pre-funded account's private key.

## Checkpoint 3: 🚢 Ship your frontend! 🚁

> We are deploying all the RUST contracts at the `localhost:8547` endpoint where the nitro devnode is spinning up in Docker. You can check the network where your contract has been deployed in the frontend (http://localhost:3000):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb82e696-97b9-453e-a7c7-19ebb7bd607f)

🚀 Deploy your NextJS App

```bash
yarn vercel
```

> Follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

> If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

⚠️ Run the automated testing function to make sure your app passes

```bash
yarn test
```

---

## Checkpoint 4: 📜 Contract Verification

You can verify your smart contract by running:

```bash
cargo stylus verify -e http://127.0.0.1:8547 --deployment-tx "$deployment_tx"
```

```bash
cargo stylus deploy -e http://127.0.0.1:8547 --private-key "$your_private_key"
```

> It is okay if it says your contract is already verified.

---

## 🚀 Deploying to Arbitrum Sepolia

If you want to deploy your contract to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Sepolia Deployment Script**

   Export your private key in the terminal :
   ```bash
   export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_of_your_ethereum_wallet
   ```

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   cd packages/stylus-demo
   bash run-sepolia-deploy.sh
   ```

   This will deploy your contract to Arbitrum Sepolia and output the contract address and transaction hash.


2. **Configure the Frontend for Sepolia**

   - Go to the `packages/nextjs` directory:
     ```bash
     cd packages/nextjs
     ```
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and set the following variables:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=0xyour_private_key_of_your_ethereum_wallet
     ```
     Replace `your_private_key_of_your_ethereum_wallet` with your actual Ethereum wallet private key (never share this key publicly).

3. **Start the Frontend**

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

   Your frontend will now connect to the Arbitrum Sepolia network and interact with your deployed contract.

   Note : Don't forget to change the contract address in the `DebugContracts.tsx` file to the one you deployed to arbitrum sepolia before running the frontend.

---

## ⚡️ Cache Your Deployed Contract for Faster, Cheaper Access

> 📖 Contracts deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia can use this command for gas benefits, time savings, and cheaper contract function calls. Our backend will benchmark and place bids on your behalf to ensure your contract is not evicted from the CacheManager contract, fully automating this process for you.

Before caching your contract, make sure you have installed the Smart Cache CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g smart-cache-cli
```

After deploying your contract to Arbitrum Sepolia, you can cache your contract address using the `smart-cache` CLI. Caching your contract enables:
- 🚀 **Faster contract function calls** by reducing lookup time
- 💸 **Cheaper interactions** by optimizing access to contract data
- 🌐 **Seamless access** to your contract from any environment or system

> 💡 **Info:** Both the `<address>` and `--deployed-by` flags are **mandatory** when adding a contract to the cache.

### 📝 Simple Example

```bash
smart-cache add <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --deployed-by <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_WITH_WHOM_YOU_HAVE_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT>
```

### 🛠️ Advanced Example

```bash
smart-cache add 0xYourContractAddress \
  --deployed-by 0xYourWalletAddress \
  --network arbitrum-sepolia \
  --tx-hash 0xYourDeploymentTxHash \
  --name "YourContractName" \
  --version "1.0.0"
```

- `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`: The address of your deployed contract (**required**)
- `--deployed-by`: The wallet address you used to deploy the contract (**required**)
- `--network arbitrum-sepolia`: By default, contracts are cached for the Arbitrum Sepolia network for optimal benchmarking and compatibility
- `--tx-hash`, `--name`, `--version`: Optional metadata for better organization

> ⚠️ **Warning:** If you omit the required fields, the command will not work as expected.

> 💡 For more options, run `smart-cache add --help`.

For more in-depth details and the latest updates, visit the [smart-cache-cli package on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smart-cache-cli).

## 🔍 Analyze Your Contract with Radar

**Radar** by [Auditware](https://github.com/Auditware/radar) is a powerful static analysis tool designed to identify security vulnerabilities in Rust-based smart contracts. It uses a rule engine to detect common security issues like unchecked arithmetic, missing access controls, and account validation problems.

### 📦 Installation

Radar requires Docker to be installed and running on your system. Make sure Docker is installed and running before proceeding.

**Install Radar using the official installation script:** (⚠️ **Windows users must use a WSL terminal**)

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auditware/radar/main/install-radar.sh | bash
```

This will install Radar globally on your system. Alternatively, you can install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auditware/radar.git
cd radar
bash install-radar.sh
```

**Note:** After installation, you must restart your terminal or run the following command so the system recognizes the newly installed `radar`:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 🚀 Running Radar on Your Contract

From the root of your project, run Radar with:

```bash
radar -p .
```

This will analyze your entire project, including all contract code using Radar.

Radar will output:
- **Console output**: Real-time findings with severity levels (Low, Medium, High)
- **JSON report**: Detailed results saved to `output.json` in your project directory

**Example Output:**
```
[ Low ] Unchecked Arithmetics found at:
 * /path/to/your/contract/src/lib.rs:49:34-44

[i] radar completed successfully. json results were saved to disk.
[i] Results written to /path/to/output.json
```

> 💡 **Tip**: The JSON output (`output.json`) contains detailed information about each check, including severity, certainty, and locations of issues. Review it carefully to understand what needs to be fixed.
